1. The syllabus has been updated. Check the syllabus (especially, grading section) again!
2. Let us use Blackboard to submit literature review report, assignments, and project reports. Programming homework will be assigned and submitted via Rosalind.
3. I assigned the first literature review assignment on Blackboard.
4. The second literature review paper has been announced. 
5. The presenter does not need to submit the literature review report. Instead, just submit PPTX (or PDF) of the presentation file just before the presentation. Then, I may give you feedback/comments/suggestions if I have. 
6. Grading rubric for literature review presentation is posted at https://biohpc.github.io/BCB5250S20/Grading_rubric_Literature_Review_Presentation.pdf
7. The group project idea and details will be discussed soon.
