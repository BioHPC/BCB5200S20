1. I extended the first programming homework due until 1/28/2020 11:59 PM because some of you implemented first Python program. No more extension, so finish it until the due with help from me or Angela if you need.
2. I assigned the second programming homework. Check it the problems and due.
3. I assigned a new literature review paper that is about coronavirus associated with the recent pneumonia outbreak.  (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.914952v1) . As we are working on Bioinformatics, it is important to read such a new paper quickly. 
4. The literature review presenter should send your slides to me one day before the presentation. Then, I will give you some comments if I have any.
